I is sleepwalker423
I'm currently enrolled in MSSA Cohort9 at Fort Campbell, KY.
I'm determined to learn everything that I can and apply it in ways that are beneficial to others and myself.
I wonder if I should go ahead and get a padded surface to bang my head against while I'm trying to figure everything out?
